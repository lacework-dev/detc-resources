# DETC Catalog

### What is the Catalog
The DETC catalog is supporting resources for the `detc` tool. If you're not already familiar with the tool; start [here](https://lacework-dev.github.io/detc).

Within the catalog, there are many types of resources that can be deployed. These 'resources' mainly fall into a few categories:

* Infrastructure
* Application(s)
* Instrumentation
* Supporting Utility

The goal of the catalog is to be a repository of reusable automation to simplify getting the required infrastructure running for testing or demonstration purposes. 

### Navigating this Catalog

There are two main 'sections' in the documentation; extensions and plans.

Extensions are building blocks; you can read more about them [here](/extensions).  However, they are not deployable plans but are used when constructing custom `detc` plans yourself (to avoid repetitive work).

Plans, on the other hand, are ready to be deployed.  You can start with nothing and have functioning applications using the existing content.

*Most people are going to be looking for existing plans, found [here](/plans)*.
